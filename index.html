  <meta name="description" content="Sometimes I am blown away by the sheer persistence of humankind. For example, consider
   this quote from my favorite sex advice columnist, Dan Savage: “Every relationship fails until one does not.” Savage is 
   referring to romantic relationships, specifically, and he makes this point to emphasize that endings of relationships 
   are the norm, and relationships that are truly forever are actually the rare exception.">
